# NPM Package Creation Example 

## What is this?
A random number generator

## Why?

As a growing full-stack developer still searching for his first professional opportunity, you learn early on about the importance of npm and what a pivotal and vital role it plays in your life.  Every project consisists of multiple npm installs and imports from various packages but I've never delved into how a package is created, or how I would create one myself.  That's what this project was all about.  The code itself is irrelevant - it was about the process.  And I can report the process is very easy!  

## Installation
Run `npm i infiniteoo`

Use:

```
import rng from 'npm_package_example-RNG';

rng(5, 10);
```

## Parameters
The Random Number Generator accepts two parameters, min and max values.

By default, `min` is set to 0, and `max` is set to 100.
